## Ideas

Stardew Valley Clone

- Each player has a **Farm**
  - Farm State
    - Crops
      - There will be a lot of different crops and crop states
      - Item Models for custom items
      - Noteblock/Strings for custom blocks
      - Could potentially use strings/saplings/berries for hitbox, and use display entities for actual crop
    - Machines
    - Containers
    - NPCs/entities
    - Structure build status (i.e. how many days Robin has left)
    - Maybe represented as a Slime world?
      - I want to embed the farm state into a greater farm area with fences etc, and I want to update this easily 
      - Or dynamically reconstruct the world every time it is loaded?\
      - Would lead to some jankiness and easy data loss
  - Building:
    - Problem:
      - Either entirely custom Minecraft building (i.e. dirt house)
      - Or blueprints that you can spawn
      - For now, keep the player in survival. Near the end of development we can modify this.
- Common areas
  - All NPCs and progress barriers are sent client-side
  - Option to show other players or not
    - This will make other players phase through other barriers  but that's okay
- Core gameplay concepts
  - Fishing
      - Create minigame
  - Mining
      - Custom cave system
  - Combat
    - Custom weapons (hammers, swords, daggers)
  - Stamina
      - Replace food bar or something
      - Replenishes on sleep or spa
- Custom Items
  - no fucking clue lmfao
  - I want specific items (i.e. seeds, machines, etc) to be per-farm. Contracts? @MarcusSlover
- Custom menu via crafting table slots?
- L (action key) for custom menu
